Detecting drowning incidents is a critical task that involves various methods depending on the context and available resources. Here are some common classification methods that can be used for drowning detection:

1. **Image and Video Processing**:
    
    - **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: CNNs can be trained on image or video data to detect drowning incidents based on visual patterns.
    - **Object Detection Algorithms**: Algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) can be used to detect humans in water bodies.
    - **Optical Flow Analysis**: Analyzing the motion patterns in video data can help in detecting unusual movements indicative of drowning.
